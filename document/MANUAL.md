## Debugger command
Start debugging by running the program. When the program reaches a spy point, it will be executed. At that point, the debugger will pause the program and display the port and goal at the current position. For example, enable the debugger, set a spy point on the predicate my_appendn, and then start debugging my_append.


```
?- ['tests/test.pl'].
yes
?- trace.
yes
?- spy(my_append/3).
yes
?- my_append([1,2,3],[4,5],X).
** (0) CALL: my_append([1,2,3],[4,5],X)?> 
** (0) REDO: my_append([1,2,3],[4,5],X)?> 
** (1) CALL: my_append([2,3],[4,5],v_4)?> 
** (1) REDO: my_append([2,3],[4,5],v_4)?> 
** (2) CALL: my_append([3],[4,5],v_8)?> 
** (2) REDO: my_append([3],[4,5],v_8)?> 
** (3) CALL: my_append([],[4,5],v_12)?> 
X = [1,2,3,4,5] .
** (3) EXIT: my_append([],[4,5],v_12)?> 
** (2) EXIT: my_append([3],[4,5],v_8)?> 
** (1) EXIT: my_append([2,3],[4,5],v_4)?> 
** (0) EXIT: my_append([1,2,3],[4,5],X)?> 
yes
?- 
```

After finishing debugging, run the notrace command. If you forget to do this, it will slow down the execution of your program.

prolog

```
?- notrace.
```

The following symbols indicate how the debugger has reached the current goal:

    **: Indicates that the goal is a spy point.
    *>: Indicates that the goal is a spy point, and the goal was reached due to the skip command.
    >: The goal is not a spy point, but it was reached due to the skip command.
    -> x: Indicates that the debugger is backtracking to a previous choice point.

There are four ports:

    CALL: The port where the goal is called. The interpreter assigns a number to each goal call. The numbering starts at 0 when the debugger is called and ends at 0 when debugging finishes.
    EXIT: The port where the program exits when the goal succeeds.
    REDO: The port where the program re-enters the goal through backtracking.
    FAIL: The port where the program exits when the goal fails.

- a
Suspend and terminate the program. Turn off the debugger and return to the interpreter prompt.

- b
The program being debugged does not exit but returns to the interpreter prompt. By typing end_of_file, you can exit the suspended state and continue debugging. Multiple interpreter prompts will be displayed for each valid interruption. For example, if there are three interruptions enabled, the interpreter prompt will display:

prolog

```
???-
```

- c
Instruct the debugger to creep to the next port, allowing you to step through the execution. Pressing the Enter key has the same effect as entering the c command.

- d
Display the current goal.

- e
Exit the interpreter and return to the Linux prompt.

- f
Directly advance the debugger to the FAIL port. This command is valid if you know that the goal will fail.

- h
Display the help screen.

- l
Leap from one spy point to another. This allows you to skip the step-by-step execution and jump to the next spy point.

- n
Turn off the debugger.

- q
Skip to the EXIT or FAIL port of the goal. However, if there is a spy point set within that goal, execution will stop at that spy point.

- s
Skip to the EXIT or FAIL port of the goal, even if there are other spy points in the goal. This command can only be used from the CALL or REDO ports.
<esc>
This is the same as pressing the escape key or entering the s command.

- w
Write the current goal to the output.

- X
This command can be used at the FAIL or REDO port. It causes the debugger to continue failing until it reaches a CALL or EXIT port.

- @
Call a secondary goal and return to the debugger when that goal finishes.

- ;
At the EXIT port, this command causes the debugger to proceed to the REDO port of the current goal.


## DCG
To use DCG call module.
use_module(dcg).

The following is an example from Professor Hideyuki Nakashima's "Prolog".

A dog bites a postman.

This English sentence has a structure. Its structure follows certain grammatical rules. 


```
Sentence-> noun phrase, verb phrase
Noun phrases-> articles, nouns
Article-> a
Noun-> dog
Noun-> postman
Verb phrase-> verb, noun phrase
Verb-> bits 
```
It's possible to write this directly in Prolog, but there's an easier way.
That is DCG. It is possible to write the above rules almost as they are.

Write the following code to a file and load it with consult in the same way as the Prolog code. 


```
s --> np,vp.
np --> det,n.
det -->[a].
n -->[dog].
n -->[postman].
vp --> v,np.
v -->[bites].
```

The grammar category is abbreviated. 

```
sentence　s
noun　n
noun　phrase　np
verb　v
determiner　det
verb　phrase
```

Let's run this on the N-Prolog processing system.
You can check if the sentence is correct with the predicate phrase. 


```
?- phrase(s,[a,dog,bites,a,postman]).
yes
```

In this way, it was confirmed that the sentence given in the list has the given sentence structure. What if you give the wrong sentence? 


```
?- phrase(s,[bites,a,dog,a,postman]).
no
```

False is returned. It violates the grammar rules.

Interestingly, you can also generate sentences that meet grammatical rules. 

```
?- phrase(s,X).
X = [a,dog,bites,a,dog];
X = [a,dog,bites,a,postman];
X = [a,postman,bites,a,dog];
X = [a,postman,bites,a,postman];
no
```

When I typed a semicolon and backtracked, some sentences came out.
The meaning is strange, but it follows the grammatical rules. 


## compiler
To use compiler call module.
use_module(compiler).

and...
compile_file(filename)

Make a file with the Prolog code to compile in this way.
Convert to C language and compile to object file with GCC.

For example, when compiling 9queens

compile_file('tests/queens.pl').

will do. This will generate a file called queens.o.

Enter ['tests/queens.o']. Or consult('queens.o'). To load it.
After that, you can use it like a normal predicate.

Partially processed tail recursive optimization. With queens, the execution speed is close to that of SWI-Prolog. 

## Multiple World Mechanism
:- use_module(mpworld).

The multiple world mechanism similar to that implemented in Dr. Hideyuki Nakajima's Prolog/KR is extended. Use the with/2 predicate.
There is an example in the mpw.pl file in the tests folder.
See Chapter 7 https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:bv252vf8932/bv252vf8932.pdf

## Edlog editor
Edlog is editor for N-Prolog.

### invoke
`edlog`  or `edlog filename` onterminal.

For more details, enter ctrl+h. see help.
