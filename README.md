# N-Prolog
N-Prolog(NPL) is an interpreter and compiler to be superset of ARITY/PROLOG(MS-DOS)

**N-Prolog is NOT ISO-Prolog.** Compatible with ARITY/PROLOG(MS-DOS) see document/NAMUAL.md

license is modified BSD.
Note: We later became aware that another system with the same name, N-Prolog, already existed. This project is unrelated.

```

# Supported OS:

- Raspberry Pi OS

- Use of other operating systems is at your own discretion.
Unsupported Operating Systems
Operating systems other than the officially supported ones (Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, Mint) are not officially supported, as I do not have the hardware or sufficient experience to properly test them.
If you wish to run this project on an unsupported OS, please feel free to adapt the code on your own.
If your modifications are successful, we encourage you to publish a branch so that others can benefit from your work.


## File Path Resolution in N-Prolog

When loading files, N-Prolog automatically resolves file paths based on the following rules:

1. **Relative paths** (starting with `./` or `../`) are used directly. If no extension is present, `.pl` is appended.
2. If the environment variable `NPROLOG_HOME` is set, files are loaded from that directory.
3. If `NPROLOG_HOME` is not set but `HOME` is, files are loaded from `$HOME/nprolog/`.
4. Otherwise, the given name is used as-is. If it lacks an extension, `.pl` is appended.

In all cases, if the file name already contains a dot (`.`), it is assumed to include an extension and `.pl` will not be added.


## Uninstall
On Linux type "sudo make uninstall" on terminal.


# invoke
To invoke npl, enter command from terminal

```
npl

-c option is for start up file.

e.g.
npl -c init.pl

-r option is for Not editable REPL mode.
Default, REPL is editable.
```

other option

```
$ npl -h
List of options:
-c            -- NPL start with compiler.
-l filename   -- NPL starts after reading the file.
-h            -- display help.
-r            -- NPL does not use editable REPL.
-s filename   -- NPL run file with script mode.
-v            -- dislplay version number.

```

## Goal
N-Prolog aims to enjoy the experience of DEC10-Prolog from the 1980s.

# Editable REPL
key-bindings are as follows:

- → move right
- ← move left 
- ↑ recall history older
- ↓ recall history newer
- return insert end of line
- back-space  backspace
- Esc Tab completion

# unicode
You can use unicode.
